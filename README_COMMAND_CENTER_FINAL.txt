To connect your Command Center to our SOS App, follow these 3 simple steps.

=== STEP 1: SETUP ===
1. Create a folder locally (e.g., "Konektizen_Integration").
2. Paste the file "aiopsys_connector.js" into it.
3. Open a Terminal inside that folder.

=== STEP 2: INSTALL ===
Copy and paste this command:
npm install express open body-parser cors

=== STEP 3: RUN ===
Type:
node aiopsys_connector.js

>>> THAT'S IT! <<<
Leave the terminal open. 
When a citizen presses SOS, your system will automatically receive the alert and popup the video call.
